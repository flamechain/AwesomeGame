# Adventures of Cliche

Roguelike game that takes place in a magical dungeon.

**OLD** - You are on board a small ship with a crew of about 20 people. A violent storm hits and you crash onto a small unmapped island. After searching he rubble you are the only one to survive, so you search the island. You come across a rusty iron door, which looks very old. You open the door out of curiosity and walk in into the darkness. You hear the door shut behind you, and the only way to get out is through. You see a dim light in the distance and run towards it.

The goal is to fight your way through enemies and bosses to escape.

**NEW** - You live in a kingdom that has been infected by a plague. You heard from your shady friend that the cure is at the end of the dungeon. You must fihgt your way through through cursed people to get it.

Insentive is your relative is sick.

Everytime you die a grave is added to the kingdom graveyard and your look a little different (new character). Random relative sick every time to add realism.
